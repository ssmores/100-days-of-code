# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Free Code Camp's HTML5 and CSS portion of their Front End Development Certification.

**Thoughts:** I was able to breeze through the first five hours (into 1ish hours), and half remembered how to do everything based on what I had learned previously.  Nothing is uploaded to GitHub, but it's a start.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent. -->
